  Healing repairs recent bodily damage. It must be used within the “golden hour,”
  though, for it has no effect on wounds more than one hour old.

  For Wild Cards, each use of the healing spell removes a wound with a success,
  two with a raise. The roll suffers a penalty equal to the victim’s wounds (in
  addition to any the caster might be suffering himself).

  For Extras, the GM must first determine if the ally is dead (see Aftermath in
  Savage Worlds). If so, no healing may be attempted.  If not, a successful arcane
  skill roll returns the ally to the game Shaken.

  Healing can also cure poison and disease if used within 10 minutes of the event.
