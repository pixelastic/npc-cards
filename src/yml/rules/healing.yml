tldr: >
  Healing Wounds Can only be done in the Golden Hour. Each attempt takes 10mn.  

  Only one attempt per Healer per Target.

  Success removes 1 Wound, Raise removes 2. Additional Raises have no effect.
  Removing the Incapacitated counts as 1 Wound.

  -1 per Wound of the Healer and -1 per Wound of the Target. -2 if no clean room
  or medical supplies.

  Natural Healing gives a Vigor roll every 5 days. Failure will add a new Wound.

  The Healing skill can be used to treat any wound suffered within the last
  hour. Each attempt takes 10 minutes.

  A character may only attempt to heal fresh wounds on a given patient once
  within the hour they were sustained.  A different character may attempt
  a Healing roll, but once attempted, that healer has done all he can for that
  particular patient.

  A success on a Healing roll removes one wound, and a raise removes two.
  Further raises have no effect.

  Modifiers: The healer must subtract the patient’s wound levels from his skill
    roll. A wounded character trying to heal his own injuries suffers from both
    effects (his wounds plus the wound penalty to the Healing roll).

  Healing requires some basic supplies such as bandages and reasonably clean
  water. If these aren’t available, the healer suffers a –2 penalty to his roll.

  The Golden Hour: After one hour, only natural healing or the greater healing
    power can help.

  Incapacitated Patients: If a victim is Incapacitated the healer must first
    make a Healing roll to remove that state, He may then attempt further
    Healing rolls to remove actual wounds.
