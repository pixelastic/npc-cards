  Teleport allows a character to disappear and instantly reappear up to 10”
  distant for each 3 Power Points spent, or 15” with a raise.  This counts as
  his movement for the round.  Adjacent opponents do not get a free attack
  against the teleporting character. If the hero wishes to teleport somewhere he
  can’t see, he must make a Smarts roll at –2. If it is an unknown area he has
  never seen, the roll is at a –4 penalty.

  Failure of either roll means the teleporter hit an object of some sort. He
  returns where he came from and is Shaken. A roll of 1 on the casting die
  (regardless of the Wild Die) indicates a more serious disaster — in addition
  to being Shaken he also suffers 2d6 damage.  The teleporter can never enter
  a solid space even if he tries. The power instantly returns him to his
  starting location as above.
