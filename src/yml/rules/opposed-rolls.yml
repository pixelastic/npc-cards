tldr: >
  Attacker does its roll first. Can benny it if needed.

  Then Defender rolls its own.

  Attacker wins if does more. In a tie, the defender wins.

  Sometimes rolls are “opposed” by an opponent. If two characters are wrestling
  for control of an ancient artifact, for example, they both make Strength rolls
  and compare results.

  When this happens, the acting character gets his Trait total first. If he
  wants to spend Bennies (see the next section), he does so now. When he’s
  satisfied with his total, his opponent gets to roll. The highest total wins.
  In a tie, the two foes continue to struggle with no clear victor.

  The winner of an opposed roll considers his opponent’s total as his TN for
  purposes of determining any raises
