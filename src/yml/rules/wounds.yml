  Extras are Incapacitated with 1 Wound, Wild Card with 4 Wounds.

  Each Wound gives a -1 penalty to all Rolls and Pace.

full: >
  Every raise on the damage roll inflicts a wound.  Wounded Extras are removed
  from play. They’re dead, injured, or otherwise out of the fight.  Wild Cards
  can take three wounds and still function.  If another wound would be caused
  after that, they’re Incapacitated (see below). Wild Cards never have more than
  three wounds—anything beyond that is just considered three wounds and
  Incapacitated (see below).

  Wound Penalties: Each wound a Wild Card suffers causes a –1 cumulative penalty
    to his Pace (minimum of 1) and to all further Trait tests—up to the maximum
    of a hero’s 3 wounds.  A hero with 2 wounds, for example, suffers a –2
    penalty to his Pace and any Trait tests.

  Timing: Characters sometimes take multiple hits on the same Action Card.
    Resolve each damage roll separately and completely before moving on to the
    next (including any Soak rolls).
