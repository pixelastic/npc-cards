  Attackers sont On Hold. Defenders font un Notice. Si Success, ont une carte.
  Si Fail, pas de carte premier round.

  Danger Sense: Notice -2 juste avant la Surprise pour être On Hold quand ça
    arrive. Si Fail, Surprise normale.

  Combat often starts before everyone involved is prepared.

  An ambush, a sudden double-cross, or a trap might all give one side in a fight
  an edge over the other.

  When this happens, the side that started the fight is not dealt cards but
  begins the fight on Hold. Victims of the surprise attack must make Notice
  rolls. Those who make it are dealt in as usual. Those who fail get no card in
  the first round of combat.
