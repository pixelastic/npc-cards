  X Raises on Toughness already Shaken: X Wounds and Shaken


full: >
  The damage of an attack is compared to the victim’s Toughness just like a Trait
  roll (though it isn’t one so you can’t spend a Benny on it). With a success, the
  victim is Shaken.  For each raise over his Toughness he suffers a wound as well,
  as shown below:

  Success: The character is Shaken. If he was already Shaken, he suffers a wound
    and remains Shaken. To cause a wound, the latter Shaken result must come
    from a physical attack of some kind—not a Test of Wills or other maneuver.

  Raise: The character suffers a wound for every raise on the damage roll, and
    is Shaken. (When wounds are caused, it doesn’t matter if the victim was
    already Shaken beforehand.)
