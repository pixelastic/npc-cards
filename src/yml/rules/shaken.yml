  If the damage of an attack is a simple success (0-3 points over Toughness),
  the target is Shaken. Shaken characters are rattled, distracted, or
  momentarily shocked. They aren’t stunned but are temporarily suppressed enough
  that they must make a Spirit roll to be effective.

  On their action, a Shaken character must attempt to recover from being Shaken
  by making a Spirit roll:

  Failure: The character remains Shaken. He can only perform free actions (see
    page 66).

  Success: The character is no longer Shaken, but can still only perform free
    actions.

  Raise: The character is no longer Shaken and may act normally.

  Spending Bennies: A player may spend a Benny at any time to remove his Shaken
    status. If it’s currently his action, he may act as if he gained a raise on
    the Spirit roll.
