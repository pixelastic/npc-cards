  This power is cast on a weapon of some sort. If it’s a ranged weapon, it affects
  one entire magazine, 20 bolts, shells, or arrows, or one full “load” of
  ammunition (the GM may have to determine the exact quantity for unusual
  weapons). While the spell is in effect, the weapon’s damage is increased by +2
  or +4 with a raise.
