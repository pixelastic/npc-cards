  If Defender has not Melee weapon, Attacker has +2 to Hit.

  Animals and Monsters are never considered unarmed.
full: >
  If one character has a melee weapon and his foe doesnâ€™t, the opponent is
  considered unarmed and is very likely in a world of hurt. Since he can only
  dodge and evade rather than parry, any armed attacker trying to hit him may add
  +2 to his Fighting roll. Nearly all animals and monsters are considered armed
  due to natural weapons such as claws and teeth.
