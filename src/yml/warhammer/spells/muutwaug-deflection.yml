  Deflection powers work in a variety of ways. Some actually deflect incoming
  attacks, others blur the target’s form or produce other illusionary effects.
  The end result is always the same however — to misdirect incoming melee and
  missile attacks from the user.  With a standard success, attackers must
  subtract 2 from any Fighting, Shooting, or other attack rolls directed at the
  user. A raise increases the penalty to –4. This also acts as Armor against
  area effect weapons.
