  Medium Cover (-2) to Range attack if more than 3" away

  -2 Parry and Fighting on Melee

  Getting up uses 2" of Pace

  Smart heroes lie down when lead starts flying. They move, shoot, and then get
  prone behind cover before their action is over, forcing attackers to go on
  Hold to attack them. Prone gives them Medium Cover against most attacks.
  Ranged attacks within 3” ignore the modifier since the target is just as
  exposed as if he were standing next to these characters.

  If a prone defender is caught in melee, his Parry is reduced by 2 and he must
  subtract 2 from his Fighting rolls. Getting up from prone costs 2” of
  movement.
