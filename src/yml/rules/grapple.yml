  If Raise, can also act.

  When Entangled, all other actions are at -4.

  Grappling is an opposed Fighting roll that causes no damage. If the attacker
  wins, he’s entangled his foe. With a raise, his foe is also Shaken.

  Once entangled, the defender may attempt to break free on his next action. Both
  the defender and attacker pick either their Strength or Agility and then an
  opposed roll is made. If successful, the defender is free but the attempt
  consumes his action. If he does so with a raise, he’s free and may act normally.
  Failure means he is still entangled. Instead of breaking free the defender may
  attempt a different action but at a –4 penalty.

  After grappling, the attacker may attempt to damage his victim on subsequent
  rounds by making an opposed roll as above. On a success he does his Strength in
  damage (gaining the extra d6 for a raise as normal).
