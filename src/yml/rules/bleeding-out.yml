  Bleeding Out: The injured character must make a Vigor roll at the start of
  each round after the one in which he was injured and before Action Cards are
  dealt:

  Success: The victim must roll again next round, or every minute thereafter if
    not in combat.

  Raise: The victim stabilizes and no further rolls are required.

  Failure: The character dies from blood loss. For nonlethal damage, he’s
    rendered unconscious for 1d6 hours.

  Other characters may stop a victim’s bleeding by making a Healing roll. If
  successful, the victim stabilizes immediately and no further rolls are
  required.  This use of the Healing skill just stops the bleeding.  See page 78
  for the use of the Healing skill to recover actual wounds.
