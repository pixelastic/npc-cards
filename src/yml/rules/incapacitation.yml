  Incapacitated characters aren’t necessarily dead, but are generally too
  beaten, battered, or bruised to do anything useful. They may not perform
  actions and are not dealt Action Cards in combat. Incapacitated Extras are
  removed from play.  Wild Cards are Incapacitated if they suffer more than
  three wounds (cumulatively or all at once). When a Wild Card becomes
  Incapacitated, make an immediate Vigor roll:

  Total of 1 or Less: The character dies.

  Failure: Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury is permanent and the victim is
    Bleeding Out (see below).

  Success: Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury goes away when all wounds are
    healed.

  Raise: Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury goes away in
  24 hours, or when all wounds are healed
