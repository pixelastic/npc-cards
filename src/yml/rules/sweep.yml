name: Sweep
reference: SWDX P36
tldr: >
  Attacks all adjacent creatures at -2.
  Roll for each creature (friend or foe)

  ✘ Cannot be used during a counterattack, with Frenzy or several times per round.

  ✔ Can be used with Wild Attack

  Improved Sweep: Removes -2 penalty
full: >
  Sweep allows a character to make a single Fighting attack and apply it against
  all currently adjacent targets at a –2 penalty (friends and foes alike—be
  careful). Resolve each damage roll separately. The attack is applied
  immediately when rolled and only affects targets adjacent at that time.

  A character may not use Sweep in the same round she uses Frenzy, nor may she
  Sweep more than once per round, or with a second weapon held in another hand.
  In effect, the hero may only perform Sweep once per action unless she somehow
  gets two entire actions (perhaps under the effects of a spell or power, for
  example).
