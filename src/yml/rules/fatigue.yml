  Some hazards cause direct damage, but most cause Fatigue—stress or weakness
  that makes a victim less effective and can eventually lead to Incapacitation
  or even death.  A character who falls victim to Fatigue passes through several
  declining states before finally succumbing to his stress. Each of these states
  and the penalties they incur are described below.

  Fatigued: The hero is tiring quickly. All of his Trait checks suffer a –1
    modifier. If he suffers Fatigue again, he becomes Exhausted.

  Exhausted: The hero is fading fast. He suffers –2 to all Trait rolls. If he
    suffers Fatigue again, he’s Incapacitated unless the hazard description says
    otherwise.

  Incapacitated: The victim collapses and is Incapacitated.  See Incapacitation
    Effects under each Hazard for what happens next.

  Recovery: Recovering from Fatigue varies depending on its source. Severe
    hunger requires food, cold requires warmth, and so on. Exactly how Fatigue
    is relieved depends on how it was acquired. This is explained under each
    Hazard.

  Multiple Hazards: It doesn’t matter what the source of Fatigue is. If a hero
    who’s already Exhausted from hunger then suffers a level of Fatigue from
    cold, he becomes Incapacitated.  A character suffering from multiple sources
    of Fatigue must address both to recover.
