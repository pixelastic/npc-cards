  Intimidation is the art of frightening an opponent with sheer force of will,
  veiled or overt threats, or sometimes just really big guns. This is an opposed
  roll between the hero’s Intimidation and his opponent’s Spirit. 

  To make a Test of Wills, the character makes an opposed roll against his chosen
  target. The defender uses Smarts to resist Taunt, and Spirit to resist
  Intimidation.  The Game Master should modify both character’s rolls depending on
  the situation. Waving a gun in someone’s face isn’t polite, but it’s definitely
  worth a +2 bonus to Intimidation, for example (unless the target has an even
  bigger gun!).  A success means the attacker gets a +2 bonus to his next action
  against the defender during this combat. A raise on the roll gives the attacker
  the bonus and makes the defender Shaken as well. This can be a great setup for
  an attack, a trick, or even a second Test of Wills if the first one didn’t get
  a Shaken result.
