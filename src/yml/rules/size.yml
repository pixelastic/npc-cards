  A creature’s size has a lot to do with how much damage it can take, so we add
  a modifier to its Toughness to reflect its tremendous mass. Note that
  a beast’s size has nothing to do with Vigor—even a mighty kraken can catch
  a cold or tire out.

  The Toughness modifiers on the table below represent average specimens of
  particular species for comparison, but there are always exceptions. Not every
  great white has a +4 Toughness bonus. A young specimen might have a +3, while
  a larger fish might be +5 or even +6. The same is true for humans. Small
  humans suffer a –1 penalty, while those with the Brawny Edge gain a +1 bonus.
  Use the table as a baseline when creating your own creatures then adjust for
  particularly large or smaller versions [...]
